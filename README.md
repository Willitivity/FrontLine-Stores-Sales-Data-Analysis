# SALES DATA ANALYSIS AND VISUALIZATION
![](<https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:828/format:webp/1*-c6EWG1E_-mvgjBcK1JFlg.png>)
I carried out a data analysis on a dataset emanating from a store. For the sake of this presentation, we will call the store *FrontLine Stores*. This is a fictional name and does not in any way relate to any real business that goes by such name. 

**DATA STRUCTURE**

The dataset contains records of sales from 2018-2020 that took place from the various sales channels available in the store. The column included OrderNumber, SalesChannel, WarehouseCode, ProcureDate, OrderDate, ShipDate, DeliveryDate, SalesTeam, CustomerID, StoreID, ProductID, OrderQuantity, DiscountApplied, UnitPrice and CostPrice. 

**DATA CLEANING**

The dataset contains 15 columns and 7992 rows.  It came clean, so did not do any cleaning except for changing the fonts and removing conflicting colours that made the sheet confusing to read.
I added 'Year' column by using '=year' to extract year from 'OrderDate'. Using the difference function, I extracted the 'DeliveryTime' column by Substracting 'DeliveryDate' from 'OrderDate' this was expressed in days for easy analysis. 
Furthermore, to get the 'Revenue' column I had to use product function to multiply 'UnitPrice' and 'OrderQuantity'. Also, the 'TotalCost' column was achieved by a product of 'OrderQuantity' and 'UnitCost'. 
I added the 'Profit' column by Substracting 'TotalCost' from 'Revenue'. 

### **ANALYSIS AND INSIGHTS**

Analysis and Insights was done using Microsoft Excel as the only tool. 

The Total Revenue generated by the store in the year in analysis is $82,792,726.60
While the store made a profit of $30,974,674

In-store sales channel had the most sales and also the most quantity of goods was sold through this channel, closely followed by Online channel.

This was also the Same case with revenue and profits realized from each channel, In-store channel brought in the most revenue and profit for the store.

There was a massive increase between revenue realized from 2018 and  that of 2019 and 2020. But this significant difference was not seen in profit realized in these years and the difference was not very much as that of the Revenue.

Of all the products sold by the store 'Accessories' generated the most revenue. And it also happens to be the most sold category of product.

**RECOMMENDATIONS**
1. There should be an enquiry into the other sales channels which performances are not up to par with the others and possibly improve on the level of services offered therein. 

2. The marketing team should improve on delivery time, this will help further increase the sales from online channel. 

3. The store can provide some kind of incentives and bonuses to best performing sales teams to further improve their performance and also make underperforming sales team to sit-up.
